![How To Write In English Language](../images/writing.jpg)

This month I'm building this website for my portfolio and my blog. However, I do not decide wherever will use Bahasa or use the English language.

But after long reflection, I decided to write all of my blog posts using the English language because I'm also want to learn how to properly write a post or article in English.

So the step I used to write a post in English is

## 1. Decide what topic I will write

The first step is deciding what topic I'm gonna write about for example I want to write about programming like javascript then I will research first the javascript language, what it is, and how to use it.

## 2. Write it

After I researched the topic, I will write it into a summary then list it into a list of sub-topic, for now, I mainly write it on my phone using the app for writing markdown GitJournal.

## 3. Check the grammars

Lastly, I check the grammars using the Grammarly app, this tool is useful because can instantly check our mistake of the post I already write.

That's it for now,
Hopefully, it also helps you if you want to start writing blog posts in English.
